## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create a very simple but complete website that includes an admin login to view the
users that have filled out the contact form. I have provided you the website and your job is to write the tests for task
1-8 using the [AAA testing methodology](https://jamescooke.info/arrange-act-assert-pattern-for-python-developers.html).

You can practice CSS with this project; however, I will be giving you a new program in the next unit. Focus on the
testing that is required to make sure that all the features of this website are tested.
